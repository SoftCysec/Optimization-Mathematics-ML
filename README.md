# Finding the Intersection of Two Surfaces
This project demonstrates how to find the intersection of two surfaces using both numerical methods and machine learning techniques.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `sympy`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow`

You can install these libraries using the following command:
```
pip install numpy scipy sympy matplotlib tensorflow
```
## Usage
### Numerical Method
To find the intersection of two surfaces using the fixed point method, run the `Question 2-ML` notebook
This will output the intersection point and plot a 3D and 2D graph of the surfaces and intersection curve.

### Machine Learning
To find the intersection of two surfaces using a neural network, run the `Neural Net Q` notebook
This will train a neural network to find the intersection point and output the intersection point and plot a 3D and 2D graph of the surfaces and intersection curve.
